# Readings: Functional Programming


## Functional Programming Concepts

What is functional programming? In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.

What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function? A Pure Function is a function (a block of code) that always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed. It does not depend on any state or data change during a program's execution. Rather, it only depends on its input arguments

What are the benefits of a pure function? Pure functions encourage safe ways of programming

What is immutability? In object-oriented and functional programming, an immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created.

What is Referential transparency? In analytic philosophy and computer science, referential transparency and referential opacity are properties of linguistic constructions, and by extension of languages.

Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()
What is a module? In mathematics, a module is a generalization of the notion of vector space in which the field of scalars is replaced by a ring. 

What does the word ‘require’ do? The require() method is used to load and cache JavaScript modules

How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in? To include functions defined in another file in Node.js, we need to import the module.

What do we have to do to make a module available? The first thing you do to get access to module features is export them. This is done using the export statement.
