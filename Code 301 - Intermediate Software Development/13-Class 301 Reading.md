## Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API (Watch a Twitch streamer code an Express API in 20 minutes!)

Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD? CRUD is a way of manipulating information, describing the function of an application. REST is controlling data through HTTP commands
If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?Usability: developers should be able to learn and use your API with minimum effort.
Reliability: the API should have minimal downtime.
Scalability: the system should handle load spikes.
Testability: testers should be able to easily identify any defects.
Security: the API should be protected from malicious users.
