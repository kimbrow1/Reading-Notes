## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack

What is a ‘call’? It can be used to invoke (call) a method with an owner object as an argument (parameter).

How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?  It can only do one thing at a time.

What does LIFO mean? The last in, first out, or LIFO (pronounced LIE-foe), accounting method assumes that sellable assets, such as inventory, raw materials, or components, acquired most recently were sold first.

Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

int  name (int a, int b){
  int tmp = a*4 - b / 3;
  return tmp;
 }

What causes a Stack Overflow? The most-common cause of stack overflow is excessively deep or infinite recursion, in which a function calls itself so many times that the space needed to store the variables and information associated with each call is more than can fit on the stack.

## JavaScript error messages

What is a ‘reference error’? an error when a variable that doesn't exist (or hasn't yet been initialized) in the current scope is referenced.

What is a ‘syntax error’?  a syntax error is an error in the syntax of a sequence of characters or tokens that is intended to be written in a particular programming language. 

What is a ‘range error’? is thrown when trying to pass a value as an argument to a function that does not allow a range that includes the value

What is a ‘type error’? an error when an operation could not be performed, typically (but not exclusively) when a value is not of the expected type. 

What is a breakpoint? a breakpoint is an intentional stopping or pausing place in a program, put in place for debugging purposes.

What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code? identifying coding errors at various stages of the operating system or application development.
