# React Docs - Forms

What is a ‘Controlled Component’? Is a component that is controlled by React state
Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why. An input is said to be “controlled” when React is responsible for maintaining and setting its state. The state is kept in sync with the input’s value, meaning that changing the input will update the state, and updating the state will change the input.
How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field? The input event fires when the value of an <input>, <select>, or <textarea> element has been changed

console.log(x === y ? true : false);
