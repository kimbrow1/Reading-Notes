# Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

SQL
NoSQL
 Fixed scheme
 Dynamic Schema
 Table based 
 Document oriented 
 Row Orientated
 model.find()
 db.select()
Uses denormalized data structure





What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database? highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined

Give a real world example! Transactions, invoices, and account balances

What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?semi-structured and unstructured data

Give a real world example. The flexible data model makes NoSQL databases ideal for semi-structured and unstructured data
Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage? Oracle NoSQL Database table hierarchy comes with the following benefits

What is a NoSQL database?A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases
How does it work?  stores information in JSON documents instead of columns and rows used by relational databases
What is inside of a MongoDB database? stores its data in collections
Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why. MongoDB more flexible than SQL Server
What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?One of the most frequently cited drawbacks of NoSQL databases is that they don't support ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) transactions across multiple documents
